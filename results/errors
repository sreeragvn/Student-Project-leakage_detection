WARNING:tensorflow:6 out of the last 11 calls to <function Model.make_predict_function.<locals>.predict_function at 0x7fada0360a60> triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.

WARNING:tensorflow:Callback method `on_train_batch_end` is slow compared to the batch time (batch time: 0.0073s vs `on_train_batch_end` time: 0.0300s). Check your callbacks.
